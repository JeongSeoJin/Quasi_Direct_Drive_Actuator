# Quasi-Direct-Drive-Actuator

This is on-going Open-Source Project of Cycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive. So I'm going to upload updated Image and Video continuously. You can look forward to my Project!!



CAD files are available in 'Mechanical_CAD_Design' Folder
Commercial Off-The-Shelf Components are Listed in OFF_THE_SHELF_SPECIFICATIONS

Thanks to the help of @jlccnc_official, I could be able to reinforce the hardware of my own Actuator for future project(Full-size Humanoid robot)!! I am really glad to see this beauty of mechanical design!! 

The 'Housing Parts' of my actuators are manufactured with PA12-CF(carbon fiber filament) and 'Cycloidal Disks' & 'Input Shafts' are manufactured with Aluminium6061. And Rotor is Aluminium7075(7075 aluminum alloy has a tight structure and strong corrosion resistance and is best for aviation and marine plates)

It could be able to have High Durability, Rigidity and Low Mechanical Impedances and so on.
